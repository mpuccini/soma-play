   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/soma-player
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   soma-player --version
   ```

### Build from Source

If you prefer to build from source or need to customize the build:

1. **Install Rust:**
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Install system dependencies (Linux only):**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev pkg-config

   # Fedora/CentOS/RHEL
   sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel pkg-config

   # Arch Linux
   sudo pacman -S alsa-lib pkg-config
   ```

3. **Clone and build:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mpuccini/soma-play.git
   cd soma-play
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. **Install the binary:**
   ```bash
   # Copy to local bin directory
   cp target/release/soma-player ~/.local/bin/
   
   # Or system-wide (requires sudo)
   sudo cp target/release/soma-player /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## Usage

### Controls

#### Channel Selection Screen
- **‚Üë/‚Üì** - Navigate channels
- **Enter** - Select channel
- **Q** - Quit

#### Playing Mode
- **C** - Change channel (opens selection overlay)
- **P** - Pause/Resume playback
- **+/=** - Increase volume (+5%)
- **-/_** - Decrease volume (-5%)
- **Q/Esc** - Quit

#### Channel Selection Overlay (while playing)
- **‚Üë/‚Üì** - Navigate channels
- **Enter** - Switch to selected channel
- **Esc** - Cancel and return to playing mode
- **Q** - Quit application

### Configuration

The player automatically creates a configuration file at:
```
~/.config/soma-player/config.toml
```

Example configuration:
```toml
last_channel_id = "groovesalad"
volume = 75
auto_start = false
```

#### Configuration Options

- **`last_channel_id`** - ID of the last played channel (auto-saved)
- **`volume`** - Volume level 0-100 (default: 50)
- **`auto_start`** - Skip channel selection and auto-play last channel (default: false)

### Spectrum Visualizer

The built-in spectrum visualizer displays a real-time animated frequency analysis of the currently playing audio stream. Features include:

- **Animated Frequency Bars** - Dynamic visualization that responds to music
- **Smart Layout** - Automatically adjusts bar width and spacing based on terminal size
- **Colorful Display** - Gradient colors from low to high frequencies
- **Always Active** - Updates continuously during playback, pauses when audio is paused

The visualizer simulates realistic audio frequency data and provides an engaging visual representation of the music being played. It's designed to work well in various terminal sizes and automatically scales to fit the available space.

### Logging

Enhanced logging is written to `~/.config/soma-player/logs/soma-player.log` with automatic daily rotation and includes:
- Application events and state changes
- Channel switches and volume adjustments  
- Detailed error information and stack traces
- Audio stream connection and metadata events

Configure log levels with environment variables:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run  # More verbose logging
RUST_LOG=warn cargo run   # Less verbose logging
RUST_LOG=info cargo run   # Default level
```

Log files are automatically rotated daily and old logs are cleaned up to maintain disk space.
